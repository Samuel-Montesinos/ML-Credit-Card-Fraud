# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This repository contains the code and materials for our Credit Card Fraud Detection project, focused on utilizing machine learning techniques to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. The project aims to enhance the accuracy of fraud detection algorithms while minimizing false negatives and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Project Overview

In this project, we developed a credit card fraud detection system using a simulated dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The project involved the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We performed essential data preprocessing tasks such as loading the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features. We utilized the `pandas` library for data manipulation.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance the predictive power of the models. Additional features, such as transaction hour and day of the week, were created to capture potential patterns and correlations in the data.

3. **Machine Learning Model**: We employed classification algorithms, including logistic regression and random forest, to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. We utilized the `scikit-learn` library for model training and evaluation.

4. **Challenges**: We encountered challenges in achieving high accuracy in handling legitimate transactions, leading to false negatives. Balancing accuracy and false negatives proved to be a delicate task, requiring ongoing algorithm improvement.

5. **Evaluation and Visualization**: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the performance of the models. Visualization techniques, including confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves, were employed to gain insights into the model's performance.
